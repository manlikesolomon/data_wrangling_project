## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration there was a strong relationship between income range and monthly loan payments. It was observed that borrowers in the highest income ranges also had the higest monthly loan payments. Owning a home or having varifiable income were also features that had an observable impact on the monthly loan payments of a borrower as home owners and people with verifiable income were observed to habe higher monthly loan payments.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation I will focus on showing the monthly loan payment distribution across the income ranges. I will also show its distribution among home owners and non home owners, distribution among borrowers with verifiable income and those with out this will also be shown.
